Our group's project concentrated on regression analysis of a partial different equation named Navier-Stokes equation. In our project, the application senario is the surveillance of building performance and we have utilized neural network regression method to complete the task.

## Before running the code

- Some basic Python Libraries should be installed first before you run the code.
```python
pip install torch
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
- If the Python in your computer is not managed by anaconda, you may need to run the following commands in your terminal.

```python
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

## Start the Code

You can easily run the code in a Python IDE, or if you use a Linux system, you should first run the following commands in your terminal

```linux
cd 'your address for the code'
```

- Then run the command and you can see the results

```linux
Python main.py
```
